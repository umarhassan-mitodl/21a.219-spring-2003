  "course_description": "Law is a common and yet distinct aspect of everyday life in modern societies.\u00a0This course examines the central features of law as a social institution and as a feature of popular culture.\u00a0We will explore the nature of law as a set of social systems, central actors in the systems, legal reasoning, and the relationship of the legal form and reasoning to social change. The course emphasizes the relationship between the internal logic of legal devices and economic, political and social processes.\u00a0Emphasis is placed upon developing a perspective which views law as a practical resource, a mechanism for handling the widest range of unspecified social issues, problems, and conflicts, and at the same time, as a set of shared representations and aspirations.\n\nWe will explore the range of experiences of law for its ministers (lawyers, judges, law enforcement agents and administrators) as well as for its supplicants (citizens, plaintiffs, defendants).\u00a0We will examine how law is mobilized and deployed by professionals and ordinary citizens.\u00a0We cannot cover all aspects of the legal system, nor focus on all the different actors. A set of topics has been selected to develop understanding of the situational and systemic demands within which actors in the legal system operate and perform their roles; at the same time, we will try to discover systematic patterns in the uses and consequences of law.\u00a0Throughout the course there is concern for understanding what we mean by legality and the rule of law.\n",
